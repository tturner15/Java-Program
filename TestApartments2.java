/*
Problem Statement:
Create a class named Apartment that holds an apartment number, number of bedrooms, 
number of baths, and rent amount. Create a constructor that accepts values for each 
data field. Also create a get method for each field. Write an application that 
creates at least five Apartment objects. Then prompt a user to enter a minimum 
number of bedrooms required, a minimum number of baths required, and a maximum 
rent the user is willing to pay. Display data for all the Apartment objects that 
meet the userâ€™s criteria or an appropriate message if no such apartments are 
available. Save the files as Apartment.java and TestApartments.java.
